# AWS Microservice Web Application Sandbox

A learning sandbox for exploring the deployment of scalable, microservice-based web applications using a range of AWS services. Experiment with infrastructure as code (IaC) and key architectural components.

**Core Cloud Architecture:**
  * Route 53 (DNS)
  * CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
  * Amazon Cognito (User Authentication)
  * Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
  * Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
  * Amazon RDS (Relational Database)

## IAC
  * VPCs (Virtual Private Cloud)
  * EC2 instances
  * CloudFront distributions
  * ELB
  * ASG
  * Amazon RDS

## Customization
- Experiment with microservices: Deploy your own test web services or applications within the architecture.
- Cost Optimization: Use the AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate costs and explore optimization strategies.
- Enhanced Scalability: Customize scaling policies within launch templates to suit specific needs.
- Multi-AZ Deployment: Ensure high availability in production environments by enabling multi-Availability Zone configurations.  

## Important Considerations
- Thorough cost analysis is recommended before deployment.
- Employ Load Balancer health checks for robust monitoring.
